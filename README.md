# cursor-multi

`cursor-multi` is the best way to work with Cursor on multiple Git repos at once. Set up your "sub-repos", for quick access to:

- Automatic syncing of Cursor rule .mcd files from the sub-repos
- Automatic syncing of your `.vscode` folder: `launch.json`, `tasks.json`, `settings.json`
